# FAQ
- How i can get that **bar**?
    - You can get that bar, by checking the **theme.lua** located in themes/nordish

- What do i need before copying these dotfiles?
    - well, you need some dependencies

| Dependencies | Why it is needed |
| --- | --- |
| lain, awesome-buttons, awesome-wm-widgets, lain, some scripts | It is used by the bar, they're in this same directory so don't worry 'bout that |
| picom | compositor |
| dunst | notification daemon |
| kitty | terminal emulator, if you don't like it, change it in the **rc.lua**|
| dolphin | file manager |
| chromium | web browser, again, if you don't like it, change it in the **rc.lua** and some parts of **themes/nordish/theme.lua** have chromium in it, so, if you use vim, id recommend you to run the folowing command: :%s/chromium/myfavoritewebbrowser/g |
